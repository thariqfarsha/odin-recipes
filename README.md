# odin-recipes

This is my first project of The Odin Project course. It's going to be
a website storing some recipes I found on the web, let just say it's my
personal recipe books lol. At first it will be just a simple plain
website since the project covers only basic html. Later I will revisit
this project and add some styles and functionalities so the website will
look pretty and proper.
